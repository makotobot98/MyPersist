- add `BuilderAssistant` or anything similar for `XMLMapperBuilder`, so `XMLStatementBuilder` can have access to cache information, namepsace ... and other necessary xml tag information in the `mapper.xml`

-  since in `XMLConfigBuilder` and all related builders, `configuration` object is of 1 configuration per sql session, maybe make configuration a singleton
